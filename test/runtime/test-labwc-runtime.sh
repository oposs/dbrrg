# Rootless Xwayland forwards XGrabKeyboard via
# zwp_xwayland_keyboard_grab_manager_v1. This only asserts that Xwayland
# *binds* that global (wl_registry.bind(..., "zwp_xwayland_keyboard_grab_
# manager_v1", ...)), not that a grab_keyboard request is ever sent. That
# weaker check is deliberate, not an oversight:
#
# Xwayland only installs its grab-forwarding hook
# (setup_keyboard_grab_handler(), which overrides ActivateGrab/
# DeactivateGrab on the master keyboard device - the path that eventually
# calls zwp_xwayland_keyboard_grab_manager_v1_grab_keyboard()) once
# xwl_seat->keyboard already exists (xwayland/xwayland-input.c,
# init_keyboard_grab(), ~L3091-3106). xwl_seat->keyboard is only created in
# the seat capabilities handler (~L1847-1859) in response to the compositor
# advertising WL_SEAT_CAPABILITY_KEYBOARD. This headless rig
# (WLR_BACKENDS=headless) provides zero input devices, so wl_seat stays at
# capabilities(0) for the entire run - confirmed in the WAYLAND_DEBUG output
# both before and after this patch. wlroots' headless backend has no public
# API to synthesize one either: wlr/backend/headless.h only exposes
# wlr_headless_add_output(), no wlr_headless_add_input_device() equivalent.
#
# So Xwayland never believes it has a keyboard to grab, and grab_keyboard
# can never fire here, regardless of whether our implementation is correct.
# Do not "fix" this back to grepping for grab_keyboard - it would just make
# the assertion unfalsifiable in this rig. Real XGrabKeyboard forwarding is
# unverified until tested on real hardware with a real keyboard attached.

# The whole ~/.dbrrg-environment override fix (dbrrg-compose-labwc-config)
# rests on one assumption about labwc's own parser: that a LATER duplicate
# assignment in the environment file wins. If labwc kept the FIRST value
# instead, the merge would silently do nothing - the same class of bug as
# the "export" prefix issue documented in
# overlay/etc/dbrrg/labwc/environment. This is tested here, against the
# real labwc binary, rather than assumed.
#
# Build a config dir containing the shipped rc.xml (labwc needs one to
# start, but its contents are not what's under test here) and an
# environment file with LABWC_FULLSCREEN_SPAN_OUTPUTS=1 followed by
# LABWC_FULLSCREEN_SPAN_OUTPUTS=0. If the later '0' wins, a fullscreen
# probe window on this two-output rig gets a single output (1280x720)
# instead of the spanned union (2560x720) that the first assertion above
# proved '1' produces.
