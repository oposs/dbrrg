# Every external command the 90dbrrg dracut hooks run must exist in the BUILT
# initrd.
#
# The initramfs holds only what module-setup.sh installs plus dracut's own
# base set. A hook that calls anything else fails with "command not found" at
# boot, usually behind `2>/dev/null || true`, while every offline test passes
# on the dev host, which has the command. That is how the hostname shipped as
# "dbrrg-", why netboot never recorded the boot MAC, and why every sync in the
# tl.new upgrade rotation failed.
#
# test-initramfs-home.sh runs the helpers with a PATH built from
# module-setup.sh, which proves the logic but trusts module-setup.sh's list.
# This test trusts nothing: it lists the initrd itself.
#
# Usage: test/integration/test-initramfs-commands.sh [initrd.img [ramroot.sqsh]]
