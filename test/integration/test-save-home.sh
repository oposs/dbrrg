# The archive must come from tluser's home, whatever $HOME says. upgrade-image
# re-execs itself under sudo and then calls this script, and sudo's env_reset
# sets HOME to the target user's home: with no env_keep for HOME in
# /etc/sudoers, that is /root. A save triggered that way archived root's
# dotfiles over the machine's home.tar.gz, and because /root holds a .bashrc
# the result was a valid archive that the next boot's restore accepted,
# replacing the user's home and ~/.dbrrg-ssh-host-keys with no error anywhere.

# Runs without root: tar, curl, ping and sudo are stubbed and their calls
# recorded. Layout is redirected via DBRRG_HOME_DIR / DBRRG_STATE_DIR /
