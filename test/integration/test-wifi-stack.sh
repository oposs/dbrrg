# Regression test for the duplicated WiFi core stack.
#
# containers/ubuntu/Dockerfile used to install linux-modules-iwlwifi-generic.
# That package is not an Intel driver add-on: it ships its own cfg80211.ko
# and mac80211.ko into /usr/lib/modules/<ver>/ubuntu/dkms/iwlwifi/. Ubuntu's
# depmod order is "search updates ubuntu built-in", so the backport copies
# shadow the in-tree ones for *every* wireless device - rtw89_core, mt76 and
# friends all ended up depending on Intel's backported core. Two copies of
# mac80211/cfg80211 in one image is what produces ieee80211_* symbol
# mismatches at module load.
#
# It was added in 2785aea ("upgrade to ubntu 24.04") where it made sense:
# kernel 6.8 needed backported Intel support. Kernel 7.x ships iwlwifi,
# iwldvm, iwlmvm and iwlmld in-tree, so the backport adds nothing and only
# creates the conflict.
#
# Usage: test/integration/test-wifi-stack.sh [path/to/ramroot.sqsh]
