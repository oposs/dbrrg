# Regression test for the ~/.dbrrg-environment override bug.
#
# labwc, run with -C, re-reads <config_dir>/environment itself
# (src/config/session.c, session_environment_init()) and setenv()s every
# key with overwrite=1. Since 10-dbrrg-session.sh used to point -C straight
# at /etc/dbrrg/labwc, that re-read clobbered any key the user had also set
# in ~/.dbrrg-environment - even though the shell had already exported the
# user's value moments before. dbrrg-compose-labwc-config fixes this by
# building a merged config directory whose environment file has the
# system defaults first and the user's overrides last, so the file labwc
# itself parses already has the user's values winning.
#
# This test exercises the helper offline, without a container: fixture
# system/user directories in, a merged directory out, checked with plain
# grep/diff. It does not touch labwc's own parser - see
# test/runtime/test-labwc-runtime.sh for the assertion that a later
# duplicate assignment actually wins there.
#
# Usage: test/integration/test-labwc-config-merge.sh
