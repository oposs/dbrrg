# Offline tests for dbrrg-password.
#
# The image ships no password for tluser: adduser --disabled-password leaves
# `!` in the shadow field and nothing overwrites it. A person at the machine
# sets one with `sudo dbrrg-password`, and it has to survive a reboot, so the
# hash is stored in tluser's home directory where dbrrg-save-home captures it
# and the initramfs restores it. dbrrg-password --apply, run before
# ssh.service, puts it back into the shadow file.
#
# Two properties are load-bearing and have each already cost this repo a bug
# in a sibling script:
#
#   - The home directory is resolved from `getent passwd tluser`, never $HOME.
#     This script runs under sudo, where env_reset makes HOME /root, so a
#     $HOME-based path writes the hash into root's home: lost at reboot, and
#     with the wrong owner. Same defect as the one cfe7aa0 fixed in
#     dbrrg-save-home.
#   - The stored file is owned by tluser, not root, like the rest of the
#     home. Until 2026-10 the netboot save in dbrrg-save-home ran tar as
#     tluser, and a root-owned 600 file failed that save outright.
#
# Runs without root: chpasswd, getent, passwd and chown are stubbed and their
# calls recorded.
#
# Usage: test/integration/test-password.sh
