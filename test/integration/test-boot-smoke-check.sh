# make qemu-smoke once failed on a good boot: agetty on the serial console
# wrote its terminal reset into the middle of systemd's "Reached target
# multi-user.target" line, and the plain grep no longer matched. These
# fixtures pin that escape sequences inside the line are tolerated, and that
# a boot which never reached the target is still rejected.
