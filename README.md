# dbrrg - Docker based RamRoot Generator

Generate boot images for diskless clients running entirely
from RAM.

The current setup is very simple, in that it just starts
a ThinLinc client.

## Usage

```
make
```

## Todo

* Integrate the booserver system
* Modularize for alternate setups

## Licence

dbrrg is released under the MIT licence.

## Thanks

This setup is heavily inspired by https://github.com/medallia/ramroot
