# finalize-upgrade.sh - Finalize pending upgrade by rotating tl.new -> tl -> tl.old
# Runs in initramfs after auto-resize, before mount-squashfs (priority 25)
#
# upgrade-image writes tl.new/ and sets syslinux.cfg to DEFAULT new, so the
# next boot loads its kernel from tl.new/ with ramroot=tl.new/ramroot.sqsh.
# On that boot this script:
# 1. Sets syslinux.cfg back to DEFAULT current
# 2. Removes old fallback (tl.old/)
# 3. Moves current to fallback (tl/ -> tl.old/)
# 4. Activates new version (tl.new/ -> tl/), and points the mount hook at
#    tl/ramroot.sqsh
# A boot whose kernel came from tl/ never rotates; see dbrrg_finalize_upgrade.

# Getting this wrong here is quieter and nastier than in mount-squashfs: a

# then find the device a moment later and boot the OLD tl/, and the machine
# would come up looking perfectly healthy with the upgrade silently skipped -
# possibly applying on some later boot instead. Upgrades must not be a race.
