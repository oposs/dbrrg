# Usage: scripts/check-boot-smoke.sh path/to/qemu-smoke.log
#        scripts/check-boot-smoke.sh --reached path/to/qemu-smoke.log
#
# --reached only answers whether the boot has got as far as the multi-user
# target yet, silently, by exit status. scripts/run-qemu-smoke.sh polls it to
# stop the VM early; it uses the same test as the full check below, so the
# runner cannot stop a boot on a signal this check would then reject.

# Boot completion is asserted against EITHER signal, because the first one is
# not reliably present.
#
# systemd writes "Reached target multi-user.target" to the console at the same
# moment serial-getty starts on that same console, and agetty opens with a
# terminal reset (ESC[!p ESC]104 ESC[?7h ESC[1G ESC[0J) that can overwrite the
# line mid-write. It is a race between two writers on one serial line, so the
# line is present on some boots and shredded on others - a false FAIL on a
# perfectly good image, observed once with the boot otherwise complete.
#
# "Startup finished in ..." is systemd's own completion message, emitted when
# the default target is reached, and is not subject to that race. Either one
# proves userspace came up; both are absent on a boot that genuinely hung, so
# this still fails closed.
#
# In practice "Startup finished" does not reach the serial log, so the
# "Reached target" line carries the check alone, and agetty's escape
# sequences have landed inside it: a boot that came up with ssh running and
# no ordering cycle failed here once and passed on a rerun of the same image.
# So the escape sequences (CSI, OSC, DCS) and carriage returns are stripped
# before matching, and make qemu-smoke masks serial-getty@ttyS0 so that
# nothing else writes to the console while systemd reports the target.
