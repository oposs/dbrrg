# Run a headless QEMU boot with its serial console in a log file, and stop it
# once the boot has reached the multi-user target.
#
# Usage: scripts/run-qemu-smoke.sh LOG TIMEOUT GRACE -- qemu-system-x86_64 ARGS...
#
# The VM never powers off by itself, so `timeout 300 qemu ...` ran the full
# 300 s on every good boot. This polls the log with
# `check-boot-smoke.sh --reached` - the same test the verdict uses - and, once
# it passes, lets the VM run GRACE more seconds so anything logged right after
# the target (a failing unit, a late oops) still lands in the log, then stops
# QEMU. A boot that never gets there still runs until TIMEOUT and is then
# failed by check-boot-smoke.sh, exactly as before.
#
# The exit status is always 0 once QEMU has been started: the verdict is
# check-boot-smoke.sh's, run on the log afterwards. QEMU failing to start at
# all is reported with its status, since there is no log to judge then.
