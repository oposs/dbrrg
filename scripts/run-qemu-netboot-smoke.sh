# Headless netboot smoke test: serve the rootfs artifacts over HTTP, boot the
# kernel and initrd in QEMU with no disk and
# ramroot=http://boot.dbrrg.test:<port>/ramroot.sqsh, then judge the log.
#
# The name boot.dbrrg.test exists only in scripts/smoke-dns.py, so the
# download proves the initramfs used the DNS server from its DHCP lease:
# curl -> the systemd-resolved stub -> the lease's 10.0.2.3 -> slirp, which
# forwards to the first nameserver in /etc/resolv.conf -> smoke-dns.py. To
# make that offline and unprivileged, the script re-executes itself under
# `unshare -rmn`: a user, mount and network namespace with only a loopback
# device, where /etc/resolv.conf is bind-mounted to say 127.0.0.1 and the
# responder may bind port 53. slirp's host address 10.0.2.2 is that
# namespace's loopback, so the HTTP server and the responder run in there too.
# A resolver that ignored the lease's DNS server would fail with
# "Download failed".
#
# Usage: scripts/run-qemu-netboot-smoke.sh ROOTFS_DIR LOG TIMEOUT GRACE QEMU_ARGS...
#
# Beyond check-boot-smoke.sh, a netboot must show what only netboot does:
#   - the hostname is dbrrg-<last six hex digits of the boot MAC>;
#   - the initramfs asked the boot server for home.pkg under that MAC, which
#     proves /run/dbrrg/state/boot-mac was recorded. The server has no
#     archive, so the request is answered 404, the ordinary first-netboot case;
#   - the responder was asked for boot.dbrrg.test.
